# Zeeman's Catastrophe Machine Simulation

This repo is a simple C++ program that uses OpenGL and GLUT for simulating the
famous mechanical device named after mathematician
Cristopher Zeeman (1925 â€“ 2016). It is a simple example of a dynamical system
with catastrophe behavior.

### How to use
Program can be simply compiled using `make` command. Some commands:
* `s` - Show projection of a catastrophe curve on the control space (plane)
* `1` - Turn on vertical oscillation
* `2` - Turn on circular oscillation
* `q` - Quit

### Some details

In some way such phenomena are quite counter intuitive, since it shows that
it's possible that a smooth change of input of a differentiable dynamical
system can cause singularity in output. This effect can be explained
geometrically looking at the equilibrium surface of a given system. For more,
